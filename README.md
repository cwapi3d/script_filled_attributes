# script_filled_attributes

Each component in cadwork is described geometrically and with regard to its position in the entire construction project. On the other hand there is an almost unlimited number of further attributes is available. Some of these attributes like color, material, name, building (building) and storey (storey) have to be set during the generation of the component. during the generation of the component. Others are optionally available to the user. Each of these attributes are explicitly defined by the user by setting them via Modify. Attributes are used to fully describe the part properties.

Furthermore, they are used for the creation of a suitable structure of the construction project and for the transfer of specific information to downstream systems such as an such as an ERP system.

Often, the content of an attribute is dependent on the content of other attributes or even geometric information. In this case, it is tedious to define the content manually. manually. For this reason cadwork provides in version 29 attributes which can which calculate their content independently with the help of a script at runtime. These are the so-called script-filled attributes. As script language Python is used. The Python script has access to various properties of the parts via the cadwork API. of the parts. These can be evaluated in the script and the content of the attribute can be calculated.

In contrast to all previous attributes, the content of a script-filled attribute is not defined manually by the user. The task of the user is to create a Python script, which on the basis of other element properties (geometry and attributes) to calculate the content of the script-filled attribute. The calculated content is displayed as for all other attributes (Modify, info window, plan outputs), can be used for activating/deactivating as well as showing/hiding can be used for activating/deactivating and hiding, can be used as a comparison and sorting criterion for the list calculation and is exported to the different lists. The only difference to the known attributes is the automated generation of the content via a Python script.
